# Navigation in react native
tried to make 3 types of navigation STACK,DRAW and BOTTOMNAVIGATION on similar screens
App.js in the root folder contains the routes for all 3 screens A,B and C source for which is present in src folder
## Draw navigation
draw navigation is the root navigation which has three keys DrawA DrawB and DrawC each calls a function sending the key 
of bootom navigator that key is actually key of screen being drawn 
## Bottom navigator 
this is pretty much similar to the draw navigator it has 3 keys and each key calls a function sending the key as parameter 
for stack navigator which sets the screen accordingly
## Stack navigator 
it has typical navigation system nothing fancy has been done here
